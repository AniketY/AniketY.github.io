Why learn C ? Many of us believe that c is suppressed by languages likes c++ and javaÂ  So why bother to learn C today

Here are top 5 reasons to lean C today



	
  1. C++ , C# or Java use the principle of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to organize the program . To use OOP one should have a good hold over the language elements of C and basic of programming skills. so, it makes sense to learn C first.![C](http://kboo.fm/sites/default/files/nodeimages/c2.png)

	
  2. Major part of operating system like Windows, Unix, Linux are still written in C because when it comes to Speed nothing beats C. Moreover when one extents his operating system to work with new devices one need to write driver programs. These programs are exclusively written in C.

	
  3. Mobile phones and smartphones have become part of ones life .Even device like microwave, oven, washing machine are getting smarter day by day .This smartness comes from microprocessor, an operating system and coding .Since microprocessor have very less memory . Therefore we need a programming language that runs fast but also need less memory to execute, no wonder this language is C.

	
  4. We all have played enough games to understand that games need to be fast enough to match our reaction . Let us consider a fighting game one of opponent is right in front of you and suddenly you triggers the bullet but it took a while to trigger it in-game and your opponent moves. To match the expectations of the player the game has to react fast to the user inputs. This is where C language scores over other languages. Many popular going framework (like direct x ) have been built using C.

	
  5. At times one is required to very closely interact with the hardware devices. Since C provides several language elements that make this interaction feasible without compromising the performance, it is the preferred choice of the programmers
