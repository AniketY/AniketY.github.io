While communicating with computer one should know the language that computer understands. Which immediately rules out English as a language but however there is a close analogue between English and C.

For example while writing English one should know the basic principles of it (like alphabets used in language ),then one should know how to combine those alphabets to make word and then combine those word to make sentence which after combination results in paragraphs.![](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/9/2/1378133969480/C-Block-008.jpg)

Similarly in C we should first know alphabets, numbers, and special characters that are used in it and then how to use constants, variables and keywords to form an instruction and later on a group of instructions are used to make a program.

Therefore steps in learning English language :
alphabets ––> words ––> sentences ––> paragraph

And steps in learning C :
Alphabets, digits, special symbols ––> constants, variables, keywords ––> instructions ––> program
