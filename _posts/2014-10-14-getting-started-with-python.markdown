A short tutorial on setting up a PC/Mac/Linux machine to program in python.

**0. Prerequisites**



**0.0 Python 2.7**





Windows :





Go to





[https://www.python.org/download](https://www.python.org/download)





and click on the link that looks like





Python 2.7 Windows Installer (Windows binary -- does not include source)





When the download completes install python by following the instructions on the screen.





Now open a terminal and type





{% highlight ruby %}
set path=%path%;C:\python27
{% endhighlight  %}




If you are using Mac





or Linux then you need not download anything as python comes preinstalled.





**0.1 A Code Editor (optional)**





A python program, or any program for that matter is just a text file that can be edited directly using any text editor. However, it is strongly recommended that you use a proper code editor since python uses whitespace (tabs and spaces, that is) to determine which block does a statement belong to.





Recommended Editors :





Notepad++ (Windows) [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)





JEdit (Any OS) [www.jedit.org/](http://www.jedit.org/)





Pico (Linux/Unix)





Vim (Linux/Unix)/gVim(Windows) – For advanced users





Emacs (Any OS) [www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)





Do not use Notepad or Wordpad to write code.



**1. A Tutorial Introduction**



Now that you have python, go ahead and open up a terminal, type “python” (without quotes) and hit enter.





You should have a window that looks like this



[![The Python Interpreter](https://Aniket.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/screenshot-from-2014-10-12-200208.png?w=300)](https://Aniket.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/screenshot-from-2014-10-12-200208.png)



This is the Python Interpreter. The text on the top tells the version of python that you are using , the '>>>' is the prompt – it means python is ready and is waiting for you command !





Type





{% highlight ruby %}
print 'Hello, World!'
{% endhighlight %}




You'll see Hello, World on the next line of the terminal.





Congratulations ! You just wrote your first program in python !





The command print takes a string(that is anything enclosed between quotes) and displays it on the terminal.





The python Interpreter can do a variety of things – mathematical calulations, string manipulations, list creation and a lot more.
